### How to Use These Folders

- **projects/** - Create a folder for each active project: `projects/my-app/`
- **ventures/** - Add Quick Glance docs for each venture/business you run
- **_archive/** - Move completed projects here: `_archive/2026-01-my-project/`

## Connected Tools

> Add configuration sections below as you connect MCP tools.
> See GETTING-STARTED.md for setup instructions.

### Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive)

<!-- UNCOMMENT AFTER SETUP:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `user_google_email` | [your-email@domain.com] |

**Verification:** Ask "What's on my calendar today?"

-->

### Other Tools

<!-- Add sections for other MCP tools as you connect them:
- Slack
- GitHub
- Linear
- Notion
- etc.
-->

## Safety Rules

### Date Awareness

**Always use the system-provided current date.** The system provides `Today's date: YYYY-MM-DD` in every session. Never assume or default to a previous year.

### Email Drafting

**Always draft emails for review.** Never send emails directly without explicit approval.

## Your Context

### What You Do

[Brief description of your role - e.g., "Product manager at a B2B SaaS company" or "Freelance consultant helping startups with operations"]

## Accumulated Learnings

> Add lessons here as you discover what works for your workflow.
> This section grows over time - every mistake becomes a lesson.

<!-- Example:
### Gmail Labels
- Labels starting with numbers aren't searchable
- Use simple names like "Needs Action" instead of "1 - Needs Action"
-->
